Not all those who wander are lost. But if you are, I can redirect you to something interesting if you click [here](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals).

I'm an engineer trained in applied physics currently @ Center for Molecular Modeling - Ghent University. My field is computational spectroscopy - specifically in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. You could check out [something on zeolites](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202202621), [something else on covalent organic frameworks](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c01414), [an application of the former to a real-world example](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.3c07036) or go [here](https://molmod.ugent.be/members/siebe-vanlommel). I also teach exercise classes in the first and second years of the engineering study program of my faculty: [Molecular Structure](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2025/studiefiche/en/E021560), [Physics II](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2025/studiefiche/en/E020220) and [Basic Mathematics](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2025/studiefiche/en/E001142). 

I like guitarists, technology, cooking and any show starring Gordon Ramsay. Reach me about anything by dropping a message at siebe(at)siebev(dot)com. Memes are generally accepted and will by default be met with a reply.
