Not all those who wander are lost. But if you are, I can redirect you to something interesting if you click [here](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals).

I'm an engineer trained in applied physics currently @ Center for Molecular Modeling - Ghent University. My field is computational spectroscopy - specifically in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. You could check out [this](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.202202621), or go [here](https://molmod.ugent.be/members/siebe-vanlommel). 

I like guitarists, technology and any show starring Gordon Ramsay. Reach me about anything by dropping a message at siebe(at)siebev(dot)com. Memes are generally accepted and will by default be met with a reply.
